 <p>
There were many changes to the original design, following on from advice given by both Laurisha Rampersad and Assoc. Prof. Michelle Kuttel.
</p> 
        <img src="figures/14.png" alt="" /></a>
 <p>
Taking the advice of Rampersad, the battle participants from which one can select was focussed upon the five kings, and the original pins on the map overview were changed to give more meaning through different visuals channels. This change is evident when one considers the difference between the bottom-most scrollbars in Figures 13 and 14.
</p>
 <p>
Blood being used to indicate the loser of a battle was also removed, although this at the suggestion of Assoc. Prof. Kuttel. The authors’ shared Assoc. Prof. Kuttel’s concerns at using this diacritic as they felt it could cause the sigils to be overloaded with meaning. In addition to this it was possible that the dripping blood could be confused for being a motif on the sigil, and so baffle viewers who would try and match this ‘new’ sigil to a House.

The final design brought more information into the overview. The decision to do so was based on the fact that the prototype paid too little attention to the “overview first” and “zoom and filter” components of Shneiderman’s (1996) philosophy. While “details-on-demand” was still a feature of the visualisation, it was more balanced than in the previous iteration.

In this iteration, better use of channels such as colour, size and shape allowed for greater detail at a higher level. A summary of which channels were used to resolve a particular query can be found in Table 2.

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one can see, shape, colour and symbols were used extensively throughout the visualisation. The use of colour was found to be particularly effective, as many fan-made visualisations have utilised these same colours. There are therefore default associations for them within the context of ASoIaF/GoT. Similarly, the sigils are known to refer to particular Houses. The other symbols used are either defaults for their purpose (e.g., the pin to indicate location) or are intuitive to understand (e.g., the symbols used for the different forms of battle).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three channels not discussed in Table 2 are depth, font and texture. The authors deliberately avoided using the latter too often out of concern that it would interfere with the texturing of the map. The map&rsquo;s textures lend an authentic feel to the visualisation which fans of ASoIaF/GoT will recognise and appreciate. It was used on components sparingly, and only for the purposes of making them pop-out. Font was used to indicate to the viewer which areas of the screen are dedicated to functional information, such as filtering, and which to topic related information, like the heading. Finally, depth was utilised when indicating that buttons, such as the timeline interval markers, are clickable.</span></p>
<h3><span  class="entry-title" style="font-size:70%">Component design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location pin became an essential component of the visualisation design in the final iteration. By shading the pins the colour of the victor and outlining them in the colour of the loser, the first few visual queries (see Table 2) became resolvable at a glance. This information was reinforced in the timeline, where the colour of the winner of a particular battle was used to highlight the name of the battle (see Figure 13). The question of who fought in the battle was broadly answered through the pin too, although at the overview level it referred more to factions rather than specific Houses. Similarly, one could see the faction of the defender on the pin, but not the specific House. This level of detail was revealed at the more detailed level when the pin was selected (see Figure 15). Finally, the pin also revealed what type of battle took place through the use of a symbol positioned in its bulge. These symbols were selected based on their association to the type of battle, their simplicity, as well as their visual appeal. Based on the positive feedback received with regards to them, the decision was made to leave them unchanged in the final visualisation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pin and map together formed an effective means of showing the viewers where a particular battle took place. This was resolvable at the overview level, but also the detailed level, where a small, transparent reference map was used to show the viewer where they were in relation to the rest of the map (see Figure 15).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the timeline did an effective job of showing the order in which the battles took place, as well as when they took place individually. The timeline also carried non-time related information, such as the colour highlighting mentioned previously. The interval markers served to give the viewer a concrete sense of the point in time an event occurred. Unless a significant death occurred, the decision was made to keep the interval markers the same hue as the highlighting of the name of the battle at that point. This was to continue the theme that the highlighting introduced. The stars were used to indicate that a significant death had occurred. The authors&rsquo; had observed that stars were a common motif for significance, being used to indicate success in the forms of stickers on children&rsquo;s foreheads, rating systems, etc., hence the decision to use this shape. However, whilst the common colour associated with stars was gold, to indicate success, it was decided to depart from this convention and make them black. Black introduced the idea that the event was in some way negative, which in this case was true, because of the deaths associated with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In keeping the final design as map-centric and high resolution as possible it became necessary to allow for users to scroll through the timeline. Shrinking the font-size to fit more onto the screen space would have made it difficult for viewers to read without zooming in using their browsers.</span></p>
        <img src="figures/15.png" alt="" /></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The viewer could choose which Houses to hide from, or display, on the map by selecting their House on the horizontal scroll-bar, as seen by comparing Figures 13 and 15. This focused on the five kings by default, but other Houses were available for selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiding and showing battles on the map was facilitated by selecting and deselecting their names from the timeline. Obtaining the details of a battle was achieved by selecting its point on the timeline as opposed to its name. This zoomed one into a detailed view of that battle. One was also able to achieve this level of detail by just zooming in on a battle or by clicking on its pin. Zooming out was also supported. For battles in which a significant death had occurred, the details of the death and its significance were positioned in the left-most panel as depicted in Figure 15.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the proportions of the visualisation have been improved after the final demonstration, the proportions could still be shown better. Ideally, the map would be larger. Currently the map is competing for the viewer&rsquo;s attention with a lot of side panels, many of which are only secondary information, and could be reduced in size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the interactive nature lends some strengths to the visualisation, it also has its pitfalls, the main of which is that printing this visualisation as a poster reduces the information and detail available. Posterised versions of such a visualisation would be a valuable source of income to its designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the visual queries can successfully be performed, but with varying degrees of ease. For example, all the spatial queries are easy to answer due to the fact that all the information is laid out on a map. Likewise, the battles are also listed in a timeline, which allows temporal orientation. However, to combine both the spatial and temporal aspects one has to click on a particular battle. Likewise, several other pieces information are only available in the detailed view of a particular battle, namely: the size of the armies, the allies, and the particular houses which participated in the battle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is easy to see patterns in the information that is shown in the overview. For example, it is easy to see who won, and where they won. Thus, a viewer can draw conclusions about the likelihood of winning depending on distance from their homeland, for example. In this way, many more queries than originally specified can be answered. Patterns and correlations easily emerge when all the data is shown intuitively, as it is in this visualisation. </span></p>
